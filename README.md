# Project Beep Boop
##### By _Trevor Mackin_
###### Individual Project: October 25, 2019

## Description

_This is an individual project that demonstrates a knowledge of how to build an application that will receive input, and then translate that input to the appropriate output. This application is intended to demonstrate a proper use of for loops, that also utilizes string concatenation, escape characters, and the ability to reason through a specification list, that fulfills all objectives._

## Setup/Installation Requirements:

* Open https://ratta2ii.github.io/beep-boop/
* Enter a number in the blank field  
* Submit form
* View current output to confirm output matches the example (below)


## Specifications:

Create a web application that takes a number from a user and returns a range of numbers from 0 to the user inputted number with the following exceptions:
* Numbers that contain a 1: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Beep!"
* Numbers that contain a 2: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Boop!"
* Numbers that contain a 3: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."

These exceptions are written from least to most important. The first exception should apply unless the second exception does, and the same with the second and third. So, for example, in your finished program,
* The number 13 should be replaced with "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."
* The number 21 should be replaced with "Boop".
* The number 32 should be replaced with "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."

## Example Output:
If a user inputs a 5, the program should display a list of values: "0", "Beep!", "Boop", "I'm Sorry...", 4, 5

## Technologies Used:

* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* jQuery (Version 3.4.1)
* JavaScript
